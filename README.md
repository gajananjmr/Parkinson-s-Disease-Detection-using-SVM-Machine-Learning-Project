# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-using-SVM-Machine-Learning-Project
This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's Disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on vocal features. Parkinson's affects the nervous system and early diagnosis can significantly help in managing the disease. The model is trained using a biomedical voice dataset from patients and healthy individuals.
